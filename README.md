A fun, tiny project where I combine my love for **teaching** and **reading**! This platform should allow students from various grades to log in, complete quizzes and tests on books aligned with their literary curriculum, and submit their answers. Teachers have their own accounts to mark students' work and track their progress.

This project serves as a practice environment for me to learn how to use **MongoDB** to manage and store data efficiently.
